h2. What's Opera Show?

Opera has been shipping with built-in full screen projection and slide show support for years (since Opera 4)! 
Pioneered the concept using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS2) that offer/include 
the @projection@ media type in addition to @screen@, @print@ or @handheld@, for example.

h2. What's FullerScreen?

FullerScreen is a free, open source Firefox addon that lets you turn your web page into a 
slide show and your browser into full screen projection with a single push button (F11).

{% step %} 

FullerScreen - More than just full screen projection:

* Built-in slide manager with thumbnails!
* Use spacebar, arrows, page up/down keys to move between slides/steps
* Use top and end keys to move to first/last slide
* Move mouse to the bottom-right screen corner to show joystick

(Use the @fullerscreen@ template pack to create FullerScreen slide shows.)
